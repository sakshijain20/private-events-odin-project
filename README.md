# Project : Associations
    You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send        invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).A       user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
